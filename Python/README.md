# Jupyter Notebook
Sometimes github can't open a jupyter notebook. So you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to open it on internet. Is good to say that you won't open a interactive notebook, for that you need to download this repo for your pc and start a jupyter notebook server local.
