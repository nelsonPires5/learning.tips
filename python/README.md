Thanks for all people that support this project.

# Structure

When a lesson is contained just into a one file(jupyter notebook or .py), this file will be named like the Instagram photo. So is just look at Instagram description and se the name, and search for it on github.
When a lesson can't be contained into a single file or for some reason it was spread into other files, a folder will be created with a name of Instagram photo.
So, for posts that are spread into 3 posts, for example, but talk about the same subject, the name of post will be the same, on Instragram, and will be add a number to specify the file.

# Jupyter Notebook

Sometimes github can't open a jupyter notebook. So you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to open it on internet. Is good to say that you won't open a interactive notebook, for that you need to download this repo for your pc and start a jupyter notebook server local.
